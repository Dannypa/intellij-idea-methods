# intellij-idea-methods
A repository that contains the methods from Intellij Idea and an attempt to utilize the CodeT5p model to predict the names of the methods. 

scrape.py file saves all the methods from the directory specified by DIR variable to "methods.json" file in the format (name, method). 
The code assumes that the repository is saved locally (to fasten the process of accessing the source code, as this can happen multiple times).
To run the file you need to save the desired repository and set its path in DIR variable.

method_name_generation.ipynb tries to predict the method names. To run it, you need to change METHODS_PATH to the path to your "methods.json" file generated by scrape.py.
